# vscodium
PKGBUILD for Vscodium

Adopt from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vscodium/), and [Arch Official Repo](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/code/)

## Difference from AUR version

No bundled electron binary, it uses system electron to start the program instead of calling a crafted electron executable.
